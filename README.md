# A Framework for Simulating Artificial Life on Distributed Systems
This is the undergraduate final year project that I needed to build for my college degree.

*Abstract*: This paper describes a software project, which is a distributed framework
for running Artificial Life simulations. Operating this type of simulations
can be sometime very expensive in terms of computational power. This
undermines the operation of the simulation and thus poses a problem to the
user or developer of the simulation software. As such, a promising solution
for this problem is to run this simulation on a distributed system, which will
handle more efficiently the large computational load that usually comes
with it. However, this is not a simple task and requires a lot of system
configurations and changes in the software of the simulation. Therefore,
this paper proposes an efficient and state of the art tool to solve this problem
in a modern fashion. More specifically, this tool is a microservice-based
framework which is able to run on any distributed environment.
